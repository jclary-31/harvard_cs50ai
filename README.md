## Welcome
This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course’s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.


## note 
The latest version of Python you should use in this course is Python 3.12.
if windows, create a virtual environnement with command 'python3 -m venv .venv'


### Course
Artificial Intelligence (AI) covers a range of algorithms mimicking human behaviour. The courses and the problems explore some of the ideas that make AI possible. Here are the 

0. **[Search](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/weeks/0/)**: Find the best route between two points, explore possibilities to beat another player in a game
1. **[Knowledge](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/weeks/1/)**: Represent information, create logical relationship, infer new knowledges with entailment
2. **[Uncertainty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/weeks/2/)**: Use probability to predict behaviour with baye's rule and joint probability
3. **[Optimization](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/weeks/3/)**: Solve a problem better by dealing with constraints
4. **[Learning](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/weeks/4/)**: classic machine learning algorithms
5. **[Neural Networks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/weeks/5/)**: Introduction to deep learning, which mimick humain brain
6. **[Language](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/weeks/6/)**: Processing natural (i.e. human) language, with an explanation of attention mechanism
